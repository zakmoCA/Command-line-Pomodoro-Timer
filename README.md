# README

This was an assessment I built during my Coder Academy course fullstack web-development course in 2023. It is based on 
the [Pomodoro technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique), a time-management technique which breaks work 
into intervals (usually of 25 minutes) seperated by short breaks, and a long break after a set number of intervals.
